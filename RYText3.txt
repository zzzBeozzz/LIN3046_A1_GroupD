Dear Professor Roberts,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a short extension for the upcoming project. Due to unexpected personal circumstances, I have fallen behind schedule and need a few extra days to complete the assignment. I understand if this is not possible, but I would greatly appreciate any consideration you can offer.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Michael
