Dear Professor Thomas,
I hope this message finds you well. As I delve deeper into the coursework for Advanced Calculus, I find myself needing some additional support with the complex concepts introduced in the last few weeks.
Would it be possible to schedule some time during your office hours for a one-on-one discussion? I am committed to mastering the material and I'm confident that with a bit of guidance, I can enhance my understanding.
Thank you for your time and the dedication you show to our class.
Best wishes,
Oliver Kwok
