Dear Professor Davis,

I hope you are doing well. I would like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss my research proposal for the upcoming semester. I have a few questions and ideas that I would like to run by you. Please let me know your availability during office hours or if there is an alternative time that works for you.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Sarah
