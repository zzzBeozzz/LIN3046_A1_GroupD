Subject: Request for Exam Feedback

Dear Professor Evans,

I hope you are doing well. I recently received my grade for the midterm exam in your biology course. I was wondering if it would be possible to schedule a meeting to go over my performance and understand where I can improve. I value your feedback and believe it will greatly assist me in preparing for the final exam.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jennifer
