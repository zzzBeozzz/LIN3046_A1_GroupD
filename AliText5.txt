Subject: Class Presentation Topic

Dear Professor Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am in the process of selecting a topic for my upcoming class presentation in your sociology course. I have a few ideas in mind but would appreciate your guidance and input. Could we schedule a brief meeting to discuss the potential topics and narrow down the most suitable one?

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,
Alex
