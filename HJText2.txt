Dear Dr. Reynolds,
I hope you're enjoying the semester. As we discussed earlier this month, I am in the process of applying to graduate programs in environmental science. Given my passionate involvement in your Climate Change Seminar, I believe you have a thorough understanding of my academic commitment and research interests.
Would you be willing to write a letter of recommendation for me? My first application is due by April 1st. I can provide you with all the necessary details and my statement of purpose for your reference.
Thank you very much for considering my request.
Sincerely,
Emily Jensen
Environmental Science Major
