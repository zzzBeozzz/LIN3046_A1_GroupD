Subject: Re: Request for Project Deadline Extension

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out and explaining your situation. I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you've faced concerning the family emergency. I hope everything is getting better now.

Considering the circumstances you've described, I understand the need for additional time to complete the project. I will grant you a one-week extension, moving the deadline to Friday, October 22nd. This should provide you with ample time to finalize your work and submit a comprehensive project.

I appreciate your proactive approach in completing a substantial portion of the project already, and I encourage you to utilize this extension to ensure a well-executed submission. If you have any questions or need further clarification on the project requirements, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Take care, and I wish you all the best in completing your project.

Sincerely,
Prof. Smith
