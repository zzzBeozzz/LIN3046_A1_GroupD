Dear Professor Anderson,

I am writing to inform you that I won't be able to attend tomorrow's lecture due to a family emergency. I apologize for the short notice. Could you please let me know if there will be any important announcements or materials covered during the class that I should be aware of? I will make sure to catch up on the missed content as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Emily
