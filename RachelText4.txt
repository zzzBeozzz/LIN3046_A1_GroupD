Dear Amy

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the upcoming biology assignment mentioned in yesterday's class. Could you please provide more details regarding the topic, submission deadline, and any specific requirements? I want to ensure that I understand the assignment correctly and can complete it on time. Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Kitty
