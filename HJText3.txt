Hello Professor Lee,
I trust you're doing well. I am immensely enjoying your course on Modern Art and its methodologies. I have a particular interest in mural art and its impact on public spaces and was wondering if I could propose a special project for this term's coursework.
Instead of the traditional final essay, may I create a scaled-down mural that represents the core themes of the class? I believe this hands-on project would enrich my learning experience and benefit the class through a practical demonstration.
I look forward to your feedback and am open to discussing this further.
Best,
Marco Diaz
