Dear Professor Smith,
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a brief extension for the upcoming paper on the American Revolution, which is due on March 15th. Unfortunately, I've been unwell this past week and have fallen behind on my research. I have been a diligent student in your class and have maintained consistent participation.
If possible, I would greatly appreciate an extension of a few days to ensure I can submit work that reflects my true capabilities. I understand the importance of deadlines and would be grateful for your understanding and any accommodation you can provide.
Thank you for considering my request.
Warm regards,
James Carter
