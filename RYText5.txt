Dear Professor Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. I have recently received the grade for my midterm exam, and I believe there may have been a mistake in the calculation. I would appreciate if you could review the grading and verify if there was any error in the assessment. If possible, could we please arrange a time to meet and discuss this further?

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Daniel
