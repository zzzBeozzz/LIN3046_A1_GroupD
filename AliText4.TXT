Subject: Request for Additional Study Materials

Dear Professor Anderson,

I hope this email finds you well. As I prepare for the upcoming final exam in your history course, I wanted to request any additional study materials or resources that you may recommend. I have been reviewing the lecture notes and textbook, but I believe extra materials would greatly aid my understanding and preparation.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Emily
