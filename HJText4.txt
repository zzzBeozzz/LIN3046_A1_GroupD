Dear Dr. Allen,
Greetings! I am reaching out in regard to the upcoming field trip to the Botanical Gardens. As you know, I am a wheelchair user and would require some assistance to ensure the trip is accessible for me. I am fully invested in participating and learning alongside my peers.
Could we possibly arrange for any additional support or resources that might be needed? I am more than willing to discuss the logistics and plan ahead to make this a smooth experience for everyone involved.
Thank you for your support and understanding.
Kind regards,
Sophia Martinez
